        <p>Overview of communication process on the example of ISO/OSI and TCP/IP layered models.</p>
        <h2>Why do we need models?</h2> <!--h2 css not working: the size is the same as of p tag-->
        <p>Mutual communication of devices in a computer network consists of several <!--p tag does not fit in the page when small-->
          stages and several elements. Each of them is equally important 
          because the tasks necessary for proper communication are carried
           out on each of them. These stages are defined by so-called layered models. 
           Each of you who has already met with layered models knows that 
           understanding this topic is the foundation for gaining further 
          knowledge and skills in the field of computer networks.
        </p>
        <p>There are two layered models, the TCP/IP model and the ISO/OSI reference model.
          (((OSI - the Open System Interconnect Seven-Layer Model, ISO - International Standards
          Organization, TCP - Transmission Control Protocol, IP - Internet Protocol)))
          On the one hand, they are similar to each other, but on the other, each of the models is 
          characterized by a slightly different approach to the way of communication.
          However, before we discuss both of these models and explain the differences between them,
          we will tell what for and why they are used at all, what is their role and what are the
          benefits of their use.
        </p>
        <p>The division of the network communication process into individual layers
          brings many benefits, the most important of which are:
          <ul>  
            <li>easier definition of the rules and principles of communication
               (these rules and principles are called communication protocols),
            </li>
            <li>the ability of network devices and software from different manufacturers
               to interact with each other, </li>
            <li>the possibility of easier understanding of the entire communication process,</li>
            <li>the ability to manage the communication process.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Before the data from the source device are sent to the end device,
          they must go through a long way, during which they are first marked, tagged, described
          with specific information allowing for their identification, then they are sent 
          between many intermediary devices until they reach the recipient, who then is to
          interpret the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there was no model that divides communication into smaller, easer to understand and
          manage stages and defines the tasks that must be performed on individual layers,
          it would be difficult to properly manage network communication because the multitude of
          solutions and technologies would cause huge chaos, difficult to Control. Let's imagine
          a situation where such a division into layers does not exist. There are no rules 
          describing communication, and each hardware and software manufacturer creates its own,
          independent system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, within the solutions of one company, communication would run very 
          efficiently and fast, but the solutions of two independent companies could be 
          incompatible with one another. In fact, in practice, we use network hardware and software 
          from different companies, and this is possible thankds to the division into 
          individual layers, which contain rules ans tasks describing their operation.
          These rules and tasks are the same for everyone, but each company, each manufacturer
          of both hardware and software can implement them in their own way.
        </p>
        <p>The best example to illustrate it are operating systems. Some users use Windows,
          some use one of the Linux distributions, and others use MacOP.
          Each one of these systems is different, each performs network tasks in a different way, 
          but in the end, on each of these systems, the website or e-mail will look the same,
          or at least similar. Thus, the most important benefits of using layered models include:
          <ul>
            <li>managing the communication process in the network,</li>
            <li>defining its rules and tasks,</li>
            <li>the possibility of interoperability at the hardware and software level of
              network products from different manufacturers, 
            </li>
            <li>and checking the correctness of communication.</li>
          </ul>

                    Normal distribution, Gaussian distribution - description</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>
                    Normal Distribution, otherwise known as Gaussian Distribution, 
                    Gaussian Curve is the most important theoretical probability distribution
                    in statistics and also the most intuitive statistical distribution.
                    In brief words, it describes a situation in the world where most cases
                    are close to the avarage result, and the more a given result deviates from
                    the avarage, the less represented it is. Most cases are close to the avarage.
                    The farther we move away from the average result, the fewer cases there are.
                    This can be easily applied to real situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Example: Intelligence level. Most people have an average level of intelligence,
                    \(IQ = 100\). Much fewer people have the level of intelligence equal to \(IQ = 80\) or
                    \(IQ = 120\), and even less, \(IQ = 65\) or \(IQ = 135\). The name "normal distribution"
                    refers to the situation of normality, that is, the case that is most frequently represented 
                    in society, the cases below the avarage level or above the avarage are much less numerous. 
                    The greater the deviation, the smaller the number of observations. The 
                    discussed situation is described by the Gaussian curve, a graphical representation
                    of the normal distribution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To understand the chart, two symbols need to be explained, \(\mu \) - means
                    mean value, avarage value; \(\sigma \) - means standard deviation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As can be seen, about \(68% \) of the observations are close to the mean, within
                    one standard deviation from the mean (a measure of distance in the statistical 
                    language). As you move away from the mean, the Gaussian curve goes down. 
                    Within a distance of two standard deviations, there is as much as 95% of the observations. 
                    Extreme values (at the extremities of the Gaussian curve) are represented by 
                    a negligible percentage of observations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In practice, these two measures, mean and standard deviation, are sufficient values to 
                    determine the normal distribution. It results from the formula for the normal distribution
                    density function, the so-called Gaussian curve.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formula for the normal distribution
                    density function:
                    \[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]

                    where:<br>
                    \(x\) - the result of the observation<br>
                    \(\mu\) - the expected value of the variable<br>
                    \(\sigma \) - standard deviation of the variable.<br>
                    <br>
                    In order to determine the probability density in the normal distribution
                    for a given result, the expected value and standard deviation for the 
                    variable and the given result should be substituted into the formula.
