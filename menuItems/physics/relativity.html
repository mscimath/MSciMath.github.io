                <h3><code>ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES</code></h3>
                <h4>by A. Enstein</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="theory-content">
                <p>
                    It is well known that Maxwell's electrodynamics - as usually understood
                 at present - when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries that do not 
                 seem to attach to the phenomena. Let us recall, for example, the 
                 electrodynamic interaction between a magnet and a conductor. The observable 
                 phenomenon depends here only on the relative motion of conductor and magnet, 
                 while according to the customary conception the two cases, in which, respectively,
                 either the one or the other of the two bodies is the one in motion, are to be 
                 strictly differentiated from each other. For if the magnet is in motion and 
                 the conductor is at rest, there arises in the surroundings of the magnet 
                 an electric field endowed with a certain energy value that produces a current in 
                 the places where parts of the conductor are located. But if the magnet is at 
                 rest and the conductor is in motion, no electric field arises in the surroundings
                 of the magnet, while in the conductor an electromotive force will arise, to 
                 which in itself there does not correspond any energy, but which, provided that 
                 the relative motion in the two cases considered is the same, gives rise to 
                 electrical currents that have the same magnitude and the same course as those 
                 produced by the electric forces in the first-mentioned case.</p>
                 <p>
                    Examples of a similar kind, and the failure of attempts to detect a motion of
                the Earth relative to the "light medium", lead to the conjecture that not only in 
                mechanics, but in electrodynamics as well, the phenomena do not have any properties 
                corresponding to the concept of absolute rest, but that in all coordinate systems
                in which the mechanical equations are valid, also the same elecctrodynamic and 
                optical laws are valid,as has already been shown for quantities of the first order.
                We shall raise this conjecture (whose content will be called "the principle of 
                relativity" hereafter) to the status of a postulate and shall introduce, in 
                addition, the postulate, only seemingly incompatible with a definite velocity \(V\) 
                which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two 
                postulates suffice for arriving at a simple and consistent electrodynamics of 
                moving bodies on the basis of Maxwell's theory for bodies at rest. The introduction 
                of a "light ether" will prove superfluous, inasmuch as in accordance with the concept
                to be developed here, no "space at absolute rest" endowed with special properties will
                be introduced, nor will a velocity vector be assigned to a point of empty space at 
                which electromagnetic processes are taking place.</p>
                <p>    Like every other electrodynamics, the theory to be developed is based on
                the kinematics of the rigid body, since assertions of each and any theory 
                concern the relations between rigid bodies (coordinate systems), clocks, and 
                electromagnetic processes. Insufficient regard for this circumstance is at 
                the root of the difficulties with which the electrodynamics of moving bodies 
                must presently grapple.</p>

                                    \(&sect1.\) \(Definition\) \(of\) \(simultaneity\) 
                <p>
                    Consider a coordinate system in which the Newtonian mechanical equations 
                    are valid. To distinguish it verbally from the coordinate systems that will
                    be introduced later on, and to visualize it more precisely, we will designate 
                    this system as the "system at rest".
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a material point is at rest relative to this coordinate system, its 
                    position relative to the latter can be determined by means of rigid measuring
                    rods using the methods of Euclidean geometry and can be expressed in Cartesian
                    coordinates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we want to describe the \(motion\) of a material point, we give the 
                    values of its coordinates as a function of time. However, we should keep in 
                    mind that such a mathematical description to have physical meaning, we 
                    first have to clarify what is to be understood here by "time". We have to 
                    bear in mind that all our propositions involving time are always propositions 
                    about \(simultaneous \space events\). If, for example, I say that "the train arrives 
                    here at 7 o'clock", that means, more or less, "the pointing of the small hand 
                    of my clock to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events"\(^1\).
                </p>
                <p class="paper-foot-note" style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 1rem;">
                    \(^1\)We shall not discuss here the imprecision that is inherent in the concept of
                    simultaneity of two events taking place at (approximately) the same location
                    and that also must be surmounted by an abstraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might seem that all difficulties involved in the definition of "time"
                    could be overcome by my substituting "position of the small hand of my clock" 
                    for "time". Such a definition is indeed sufficient if time has to be defined 
                    exclusively for the place at which the clock is located; but the definition 
                    becomes insufficient as soon as series of events occuring at different
                    locations have to be linked temporally, or - what amounts to the same - events
                    occuring at places remote from the clock have to be evaluated temporally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be sure, we could content ourselves with evaluating the time of the events 
                    by stationing an abserver with the clock at the coordinate origin, and 
                    having him assign the corresponding clock-hand position to each light signal 
                    that attests to an event to be evaluated and reaches him through empty space.
                    But as we know from experience, such an assignment has the drawback that it is 
                    not independent of the position of the observer equipped with the clock. We 
                    arrive at a far more practical arrangement by the following consideration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is a clock at point \(A\) of space, then an observer located at \(A\) 
                    can evaluate the time of the events in the immediate vicinity of \(A\) by finding
                    the clock-hand positions that are simultaneous with these events. If there is 
                    also a clock at point \(B\) - we should add, "a clock of exactly the same 
                    constitution as that at \(A\)" - then the time of the events in the immediate vicinity
                    of \(B\) can likewise be evaluated by an observer located at \(B\). But it is not 
                    possible to compare the time of an event at \(A\) with one at \(B\) without a further
                    stipulation: thus far we have only defined an "\(A\)-time" and a "\(B\)-time" but not 
                    a "time" common to \(A\) and \(B\). The latter can now be determined by establishing 
                    \(by \space definition\) that the "time" needed for the light to travel from \(A\) to \(B\) is 
                    equal to the "time" it needs to travel from \(B\) to \(A\). For, suppose a ray of
                    light leaves from \(A\) toward \(B\) at "\(A\)-time" \(t_A\), is reflected from \(B\) toward \(A\) at
                    "\(B\)-time" \(t_B\), and arrives back at \(A\) at "\(A\)-time" \(t^1_A\). The two clocks
                    are synchronous by definition if  
                    \[{t_B - t_A = t^1_A - t_B .}\]
                    </p>
                <p>
                    We assume that it is possible for this definition of synchronism to be 
                    free of contradictions, and to be so for arbitrarily many points, and that the 
                    following relations are therefore generally valid:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. If the clock in \(B\) is synchronous with the clock in \(A\), then the clock 
                    in \(A\) is synchronous with the clock in B.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. If the clock in \(A\) is synchronous with the clock in \(B\) as well as with 
                    the clock in \(C\), then the clocks in \(B\) and \(C\) are also synchronous relative to
                    each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the help of some physical (thought) experiments, we have thus laid down 
                    what it is to be understood by synchronous clocks at rest that are situated 
                    at different places, and have obviously obtained thereby a definition of 
                    "synchronous" and of "time". The "time" of an event is the reading obtained 
                    simultaneously with the event from a clock at rest that is located at the 
                    place of the event and that for all time determinations is in synchrony with a 
                    specified clock at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on experience, we also postulate that the quantity
                  \[\frac{2\overline{AB}}{t'_A - t_A}= V \]
                  is a universal constant (the velocity of light in empty space).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is essential that we have defined time by means of clocks at rest in a system 
                  at rest; because it belongs to the system at rest, we designate the time just 
                  defined as "the time of the system at rest."
                </p>
                \(&sect2. On the relativity of lengths and times\)
                <p>
                  The considerations that follow are based on the principle of relativity and
                  the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, two principles that
                  we define as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. The laws governing the changes of the state of any physical system
                  do not depend on which one of two coordinate systems is uniform translational
                  motion relative to each other these changes of the state are referred to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Each ray of light moves in the coordinate system "at rest" with the
                  definite velocity \(V\) independent of whether this ray of light is emitted
                  by a body at rest or a body in motion. Here, 
                  \[velocity = \frac{light\space path}{time\space interval},\]
                  where "time interval" should be understood in the sense of the definition in &sect1.

                <p>
                  Let there be given a rigid rod at rest; its length, measured by a measuring rod that is also at rest,
                  shall be \(l\). We now imagine that the axis of the rod is placed along the 
                  \(X\)-axis of the coordinate system at rest, and that the rod is then set in uniform
                  parallel translational motion (velocity \(v\)) along the \(X\)-axis 
                  in the direction of increasing \(x\). We now seek to determine the length of 
                  the \(moving\) rod, which we imagine to be obtained by the following 
                  two operations:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) The observer co-moves with the above-mentioned measuring rod and the
                  rod to be measured, and measures the length of the rod directly, by applying the
                  measuring rod exactly as if the rod to be measured, the observer, and the 
                  measuring rod were at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using clocks at rest that are set up in the system at rest and are 
                  synchronous in the sens of &sect1, the observer determines the points of 
                  the system at rest at which the beginning and the end of the rod to be measured
                  are found at some given time \(t\). The distance between these two points, 
                  measured by the rod used before, which in the present case is at rest, 
                  is also a length, which can be designated as the "length of the rod".
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the principle of relativity, the length to be found in operation (a),
                  which we shall call "the length of the rod in the moving system", must equal 
                  the length \(l\) of the rod at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will determine the length to be found in operation (b), which we shall call
                  "the length of the (moving) rod in the system at rest", on the basis of our two
                  principles, and will find it to be different from \(l\).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The commonly used kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths determinedby the two methods 
                  mentioned are exactly identical, or, in other words, that in the time epoch \(t\) 
                  a moving rigid body is totally replaceable, as far as geometry is concerned, by the 
                  \(same\) body when it is \(at\space rest\) in a particular position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further, we imagine that the two ends (\(A\) and \(B\)) of the rod are equipped
                  with clocks that are synchronous with the clocks of the system at rest, i.e.,
                  whose readings always correspond to the "time of the system at rest" at the 
                  locations they happen to occupy; hence, these clocks are "synchronous in the system 
                  at rest".
                </p>
                <p>
                  We further imagine that each clock has an observer co-moving with it,
                  and that these observers apply to the two clocks the criterion for synchronism
                  formulated in &sect1. Suppose a ray of light starts out from \(A\) at time\(^1\space t_A\),
                  is reflected from \(B\) at time \(t_B\), and arrives back at \(A\) at time \(t'_A\). 
                  Taking into account the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, we find that
                  \[t_B - t_A = \frac{r_{AB}}{V - v} \]
                  and
                  \[t'_A - t_B = \frac{r_{AB}}{V + v}, \]
                  where \(r_{AB}\) denotes the length of the moving rod, measured in the system at rest.
                  The observers co-moving with the moving rod would thus find that the two clocks do 
                  not run synchronously while the observers in the system at rest would declare them
                  synchronous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus we see that we must not ascribe \(absolute\) meaning to the concept of simultaneity; 
                  instead, two events that are simultaneous when observed from some particular 
                  coordinate system can no longer be considered simultaneous when observed from a system 
                  that is moving relative to that system.
                </p>
                \(&sect3.\space Theory of transformation of coordinates\space and time from a system at rest
                 to a system in uniform translational motion relative to it\)
                <p>
                  Let there be given two coordinate systems in the space "at rest," i.e.,
                  two systems of three mutually perpendicular rigid material lines issuing from one point.
                  Let the \(X\)-axes of the two systems coincide and their \(Y\)- and \(Z\)-axes be parallel.
                  Each system shall be supplied with a rigid measuring rod and a number of clocks, and the 
                  two measuring rods and all the clocks of the two systems should be exactly alike.
                </p>
                \(^1\)"Time" here means both "time of the system at rest" and "the position of the 
                hands of the moving clock located at the place in question."
                <p>
                  The origin of one of the two systems \((k)\) shall now be imparted a (constant)
                  velocity \(v\) in the direction of increasing \(x\) of the other system \((K)\),
                  which is at rest, and this velocity shall also be imparted to the coordinate axes,
                  the corresponding measuring rod, and the clocks. To each time \(t\) of the system at rest 
                  \(K\) there corresponds then a definite position of the axes of the moving system,
                  and for reasons of symmetry we may rightfully assume that the motion of \(k\) can be such 
                  that at time \(t\) ("\(t\)" always denotes a time of the system at rest) the axes of
                  the moving system are parallel to the axes of the system at rest.
                </p>
                <p>We now imagine the space to be measured both from the system at rest \(K\) by means 
                  of the measuring rod at rest and from the moving system \(k\) by means of the 
                  measuring rod moving along with it, and that the coordinates \(x, \space y, \space z\) and
                  \(\xi, \space\eta, \space\zeta\) are obtained in this way. Further, by means of the clocks
                  at rest in the system at rest and using light signals in the manner described in &sect1, the
                  time \(t\) of the system at rest is determined for all its points where there is a clock;
                  likewise, the time \(\tau\) of the moving system is determined for all the points 
                  of the moving system having clocks that are at rest relative to this system, applying 
                  the method of light signals described in &sect1 between
                </p>
